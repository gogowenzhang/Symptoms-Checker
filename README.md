# Symptoms-Checker

#### For Apixio coding challenge:

Author: Wen Zhang

#### Summary: 

I have been thinking about creating a symptom checker application for a while. And this task happens to be aligned with my motivation. So I come up with this project which is to cluster diesease symptom information into different groups. The project will focus on online info retrieving, text preprocessing and a simple K Means modeling. The result of this project could provide insight for future disease classfication based on symptoms. 

#### Steps:

1. Retrieves symptom information of 11 different diseases from https://www.mayoclinic.org/. I particularly selected diseases form three categories: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. 
List of the urls of these diseases can be found [here](https://github.com/gogowenzhang/Symptoms-Checker/blob/master/src/main/resources/urls.csv). 

2. Preprocessing:
  * Tokenize: 
  * Lemmatize:
  * Remove stop words:
  * Vectorize:

3. Modeling:


#### Results:
