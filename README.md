# Symptoms-Checker

For Apixio coding challenge:

1. Retrieves symptom information of 11 different diseases from https://www.mayoclinic.org/. List of the urls of these selected diseases can be found in https://github.com/gogowenzhang/Symptoms-Checker/blob/master/src/main/resources/urls.csv

2. 

1. Retrieve at least 10 different pages of text from the web (pick some website and use some code to retrieve the html)
Clean, tokenize and normalize the page to optimally get only the actual textual content. Text normalization is hard, do your best.
2. Represent the pages as vectors, using some sort of a hashing trick.
3. Run a simple (does not have to scale) K-means implementation to cluster those pages into 3 clusters.
4. Show that the results make sense, meaning that there is some similarity between the pages in the same cluster.
