# Symptoms-Checker

For Apixio coding challenge:

1. Retrieve at least 10 different pages of text from the web (pick some website and use some code to retrieve the html)
Clean, tokenize and normalize the page to optimally get only the actual textual content. Text normalization is hard, do your best.
2. Represent the pages as vectors, using some sort of a hashing trick.
3. Run a simple (does not have to scale) K-means implementation to cluster those pages into 3 clusters.
4. Show that the results make sense, meaning that there is some similarity between the pages in the same cluster.
